# Changelog

## 1.1.0

- Synchronize applicable platform features with GetMCPAds commit b1471be while retaining local read-only exploration tools and credential configuration.
- Expose 33 read tools and 27 explicitly enabled write tools.
- Add MCP annotations, parameter descriptions, structured results, server identity and an offline-generated discovery card.
- Preserve preview/confirmation boundaries; test provider request construction and errors with mocked APIs.
- Refuse credential-bearing redirects and document provider-specific limitations.

No live advertiser mutation is performed by the release tests.
